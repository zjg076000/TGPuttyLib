RECOMMENDATION
--------------

Please consider just using the TTGPuttySFTP class in tgputtysftp.pas
rather than the TTGPuttySFTPClient component in tgputtysftpclient.pas.
Just include the folder with thePascal source files in your compiler path.

The class has many advantages! You don't have to install anything into the IDE.
Much easier when you switch to a newer Delphi version in the future.

You can just create the class and assign properties in Delphi code, rather than using
the component.

Take a look at the DelphiVCLDemo example, rather than DelphiVCLComponentDemo.

Note that the TTGPuttySFTP class uses AnsiStrings, so you need to work with Utf8Encode and Utf8Decode or Utf8ToString.

The component, on the other hand, uses UnicodeStrings.
